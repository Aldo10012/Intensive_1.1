Everyone has habits, and many try to track them. There are many habit trackers and event managers out there: Todoist, Momentum, Habitica, etc. They all share common features: track how often you complete a task/habit and records it. However, our lives are complex and ever-changing, our habits should too. What all these habit-tracking systems fail to accomplish is to provide a means to reflect on one's goal and adapt their habit accordingly. 

Created by Martin Boehme, the "Martin Method" provides such a solution. Instead of counting streeks, this method records your habits on a two-week cycle, in which you record whether you succeeded in accomplishing your goal or had a setback. There is also a section provided called the "setback notes" in which you write out the reason why you had a setback. By the end of the two weeks, you reflect in the "cycle review" section, pondering the reasons why you had setbacks and adjust your goals accordingly to make them more achievable. This allows for a more thoughtful and realistic goal setting.
