MARTIN METHOD HABIT TRACKER

PROJECT MOTIVATION:
More than ever before, interest in habit formation and habit tracking has surged. As people try to before productive throughout the day and make commitments to themselves, they make and track habits of their choice. However, most people set over-ambitious goals. For example, workout every day. Often times, our habits and commitments overwhelm us and we simply give up; we don't set realistic expectations. 

This project is a habit tracker that uses the Martin Method. This method allows for more intentional, thoughtful, and reflective habit formation. Rather than relying on streeks to fuel motivation, the martin method allows users to reflect on their habits every 2 weeks and allows them to make appropriate adaptations.
